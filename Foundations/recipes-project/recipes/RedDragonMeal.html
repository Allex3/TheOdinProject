    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This meal is prepared by Senshi using different parts of the Red Dragon they had slain. A dough is made and covered with onions and cheese and baked on a lightly floured dragon scale in the dragon's accidentally lit insides. The tip of the dragon's tail is skinned and the meat added to a soup. Meat from the inside of the dragon's body is browned on the heated scales and seasoned to taste.</p>
