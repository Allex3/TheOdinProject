    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A tart-like dish created by Senshi from the fruit of different Man-eating Plants. Described as salty by the group, it is likely to be more akin to a quiche but with an inedible shell. A mixture of mashed up and cut up Man-Eating Plant fruit, slime and scorpion soup is poured into a pan lined with the flattened peel of the fruit and cooked before garnishing with some more fruit.</p>

        <li>Leftover scorpion broth (from lunch; 200 ml)</li>
